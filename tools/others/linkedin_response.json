        "As lead developer on a variety of software projects at Tribune, parent company of the LA Times and many other high profile newspapers, Ram displayed some of the best technical acumen of any developer I've worked with along with great qualities of character including leadership, humor, and painstaking attention to detail. He very smoothly navigated all aspects of development from initial requirements gathering to coordinated communication among various parties for release approval. We worked closely together on a key and highly visible project for Tribune that involved back end and front end feature development, sequential releases to production, coordination with QA, and input from across the organization, both geographically and across departments. Ram's knowledge and demeanor facilitated this process immensely as he both inspired confidence in what we were doing across the organization, and lead a cross functional technology team to accomplish important goals in a timely manner. Ram will be a great asset to any organization looking to travel the sometimes twisting journey from inception of an idea to shipping fully functional and value adding products. He's a rare combination of a very technically adept leader.",
        "Vahak Matavosian",
        "I worked with Ram for more than four years and I saw him take on different roles, always performing them very competently. As a software developer and technical lead he was detail oriented, technically sound and knowledgable. Later on, as the Director of software development, he was organized, approachable and open to different ideas. He always listened to his team and most importantly never micro managed the team members. I would gladly work with him again."
